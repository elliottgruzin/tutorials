# CNNs and GANs

## Introduction

This tutorial concerns manipulating, classifying, and generating image data. Things I go through in this tutorial include:

- Manipulating image tensors ðŸŒŒ
- How operations in CNNs work (convolutions, max pooling) ðŸŒŒâ†’ðŸ§ 
- How transposed convolutions work for creating images from feature vectors ðŸ§ â†’ðŸŒŒ
- The necessary improvements from a first pass implementation to take GANs from failure to success ðŸ”§

A side note - most of my career (academic and industry) has been in speech/language data, so quite a bit of this tutorial is spent going through how this data looks and feels to someone who has done a lot of machine learning outside of the image domain.

## Setup

Standard. Just do the poetry setup as per. Enjoy!
