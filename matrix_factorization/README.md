# Matrix factorization

This notebook uses the Netflix Prize Dataset to do Matrix Factorization, an extremely basic recommendation algorithm approach for movies ðŸŽ¬

I wrote this tutorial as I was getting back into PyTorch coding, so it might be helpful if you need a refresher on some PyTorch fundamentals.

## Setup

The only setup element on top of the common poetry environment setup needed for this script is the dataset. That can be accessed on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/code). Download and unzip the file into this directory, and then run the notebook.
