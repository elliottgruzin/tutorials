# Tutorials

Machine learning tutorials where you can learn alongside me.

## Purpose

These tutorials are meant for those who have experience in Machine Learning to some degree. I like to explore concepts from the ground up, so looking at fundamental tensor operations and experimenting with what comes out is usually kept in my tutorials. I hope you enjoy ðŸ‘¹ .

## Setup

Each tutorial can be setup in the same way. I use poetry for package management (its a LOT better than pip) so if you haven't installed that you can do so [here](https://python-poetry.org/) (the documentation has dark mode so there's no excuse to not read it). Following that, simply go into each directory, setup a new poetry environment via `poetry install` and run the Jupyter notebook. Some tutorials will be *much* faster on a GPU, so you can run them on Colab (for free!) to run through them and experiment quicker.
